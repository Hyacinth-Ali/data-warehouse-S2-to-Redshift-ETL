# Data Warehouse (S3 to AWS Redshift ETL)
This is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline project, which leverages AWS services (S3 and Redshift) to build a data warehouse for a startup company. 


## Problem Statement
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to.

## Project Dataset
There are three datasets in S3 (Song, log, and log_json datasets), which are required to extract, transform, and then load into Redshift. 

### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{
  "num_songs": 1, 
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
  "artist_latitude": null, 
  "artist_longitude": null, 
  "artist_location": "", 
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
  "duration": 152.92036, 
  "year": 0
}
```
### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Log_Json Dataset
The content of the third dataset, which contains meta information about the log dataset, is shown below.
